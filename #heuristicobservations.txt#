TAKEAWAYS
Usability seems generally more universal than the usability of video game
tutorials.

Dark Souls 2:
The tutorial reflects the desired gameplay experience. It is not supposed to be forced on the player even in the early stage.

Ori and the Blind Forest:
The tutorial reflects the pacing of the gameplay. Teach mechanics in the proper context when they are first needed.

Heroes of the Storm:
Have separate tutorials for different aspects of the gameplay if necessary (e.g. character development and arena-specific mechanics)

Psychonauts:
Teach basic movement controls interactively before the actual game starts.
Have the first area of the game be a tutorial section that needs to be completed before the rest of the game becomes available.

Quake Live:
Think about the possibility of combining video demonstrations with the tutorial.
Use a training match with an NPC character for familiarity before playing against actual people.

Rocket League:
When teaching controls, consider only allowing the currently required controls to be available and pace the tutorial accordingly.

Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator:
Use a detailed obstacle course to make sure all the required controls are used.
Go beyond the basic controls and teach possible combinations and applications of the controls that will allow the player to start thinking about his own style and variations.

Quake Champions (beta):
Consider using a separate video that can be available online to demonstrate the basic principles of the game.

Dead Cells (early access):
