\chapter{Conclusion}
Usability seems generally more universal than the usability of video game tutorials. Usability of a tutorial can not be generalized in the same way as easily as general usability of an interface for example.

Judging from the success of certain recent years' hit games such as the Dark Souls series, it can also be argued that if you set out to make a game based on certain recognized industry standards and an enjoyable experience in mind, you might have already taken your first wrong turn. Different target groups can want two opposite things, so it's difficult to generalize.
