\chapter{Analyzing expert review results}
It is interesting to note that even though the tutorial can be in its own category when heuristics are defined, it can still have many elements from different heuristics categories. It is not only that there is a tutorial element in the game, but also that the tutorial has elements from a wide range of elements in the gameplay heuristics. This means that tutorials can be evaluated e.g. from a gameplay perspective, not only from a tutorial or a usability perspective. The game goals being clear and that the skills needed to attain those goals are taught in an orderly fashion belong in a sense to gameplay heuristics, but those can be easily applied to tutorial settings as well.
