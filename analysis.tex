\chapter{Analyzing expert review results}

How to combine our experience with the games in the previous chapter with the heuristics we looked at earlier? Since there are games from various genres it is justified to have a somewhat abstract take on have they are or should be presented. One central thing emerges from the concept of a tutorial: it does not generally matter if you have a separate tutorial, or a sort of in-game help and instruction that guides the player in to the game. The tutorial, then, becomes a little ambiguous as a concept. A game might instruct the player really well but not have a separate tutorial to do that, or the game might have a separate tutorial and also instruct the player really well in that as well. It is safe to say that when we are talking about a tutorial, we can talk about the way the game attempts to transfer the required knowledge to the player, as we defined tutorials in an earlier chapter.
